Should we use classes or not?

Do we want to do a latch style load like the pyrosphere or just use Adafruit_WS2801?

Do we use PGMspace to store the mappings?
How do we easily load different maps!? Grid class is hard to abstract and essentially changes for every project but is a core tranlsation all of the time. q();

Serial Polling... how should we do it? How can we do it better than the pyrosphere.


== Transitioning
What if we assume each effect transitions and only turn it off when it shouldnt. 

Effect completes - interval 0
Get new selector
Set future color grid - 
Decompose colors
Iterate through transition sequence


== Movement within effects
Setup easing of frequency within iteration

== Pattern


Grid has
	mode,
	orientation,
	panelsX,
	panelsY,
	pixelsX,
	pixelsY,
	total;

	strandq[],
	panelsq[], // for criss-cross like the Fan or a Test Panel.
	mirroredq[],
	ceilingq[];			

Controller has
	total,
	test,
	debug,
	selector,			
	intensity,
	frequency,
	sustain,
	density,
	division,
	r,g,b,a,
	index,					
	mode = chill, party, impress, static	
	
	now
	then
	pduration
	iduration
	interval,
	phase;

	orientation,
	direction;


Creamery

	Each effect function will
		update the current array colors (structs or 32bit...)
		have certain triggers to know if it's done or just starting....
		loop count decrement
		default values / overrides



Utilities

	Random Color,
	Random Wheel
